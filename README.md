# IoT-Experiments Arduino Boards

Configuration and other support files to use IoT-Experiments's boards with the Arduino IDE.
This is provided as a reference for modifying the Arduino IDE to support custom boards.

These files are only compatible with the 1.6.x series of Arduino IDE and NOT the earlier 1.0.x series.  The contents of this repository should be cloned/copied into an Arduino/hardware/adafruit/avr folder.

NOTE: Arduino IDE version 1.6.2 has a bug with supporting external cores and DOES NOT work with these files.  Use Arduino 1.6.3+, or an earlier version like 1.6.1.
